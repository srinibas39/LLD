# UML Diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is used to design a rough idea of your application, i.e., to represent **classes**, **objects**, and their **relationships**.

## Types of UML Diagrams

UML diagrams are broadly classified into:

* **Structural Diagrams** (7 types)
* **Behavioral Diagrams** (7 types)

### In This Guide:

We will focus on:

* **Class Diagram** (from Structural diagrams)
* **Sequence Diagram** (from Behavioral diagrams)

## Class Diagrams

Class diagrams represent the static structure of a system by showing its **classes**, their **attributes**, **methods**, and the **relationships** among objects.

### Associations in Class Diagrams

There are three main types of associations:

1. **Simple Association** â€“ A basic link between two classes.
2. **Aggregation** â€“ A "has-a" relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.
3. **Composition** â€“ A **strong "has-a"** relationship where the child **cannot exist independently** of the parent.

Additionally:

* **Inheritance** â€“ An **"is-a"** relationship between classes.

> ðŸ’¡ **Composition** is very important to understand in system design.

## Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams represent the **communication between objects** in a time sequence.

They show:

* How objects interact
* The order of messages exchanged between them

---

## Summary

* UML helps visualize system design and object interactions.
* **Class Diagram** shows structure.
* **Sequence Diagram** shows behavior over time.
