//This is not preferred in production , In large or complex applications, the singleton might never be used â€” but it's still created at startup.

// If the constructor of the singleton is resource-heavy (e.g., opens DB connection, reads configs), it wastes memory and time unnecessarily.
//It is okay for small application
